# web_scraping
My first web scraping projects


# 🎬 IMDb Movie Info Fetcher (with Selenium) - selenium_test.py

This is a simple Python script that uses Selenium to search for a film on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com) and return its **title** and **release year**. The user inputs the movie name, and the script automatically opens IMDb, performs the search, and extracts the relevant information.

# 📝 Quotes Scraper with BeautifulSoup - web_scraping.py

This is a second, simpler web scraping script included in the project. It uses the `requests` library and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape quotes and their authors from [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com/), a website made for practicing web scraping.
