# ðŸŽ¬ IMDb Movie Info Fetcher (with Selenium) - selenium_test.py

This is a simple Python script that uses Selenium to search for a film on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com) and return its **title** and **release year**. The user inputs the movie name, and the script automatically opens IMDb, performs the search, and extracts the relevant information.
